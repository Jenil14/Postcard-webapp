# Daily Postcard 

## Introduction

Keeping in touch with family and friends is important, especially when we are busy and stressed. This app lets a user create a postcard sharing a moment of their day. The postcard creater can send more than one postcard at a time. To do this, the server will keep the data for all the postcards in a database. Each postcard will have a different URL, so that each recipient will see something different. The URLs will be different because each will include a random string. The users make personal cards to send to specific loved ones, and use Flickr to store and share our postcard images.
